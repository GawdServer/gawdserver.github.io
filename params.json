{"name":"GawdServer","tagline":"A new style of Minecraft server modding.","body":"### What is the GawdServer?\r\nThe GawdServer is a new modding API for Minecraft servers.\r\nWhat makes the GawdServer different is that it is a launcher instead of a wrapper.\r\nThis allows you to control the server without ever modifying the servers code.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nUnlike Bukkit, which wrappes the Minecraft server and creates hooks and events in the code;\r\nThe GawdServer will instead listen to the server and send the server commands as necessary.\r\n\r\nFor example, player Steve types into chat **_!home_**\r\n> The server will look for the home handle. If you have the home plugin, the home plugin will lookup the players home coordinates and respond to the server `tp Steve 123 45 678`\r\n\r\n### Setting up a Server\r\nStarting a GawdServer is aimed to be as simple as Bukkit.\r\n\r\n1. Download the latest GawdServer build from [here](https://github.com/GawdServer/GawdServer/releases/latest).\r\n2. Download a Minecraft server. This can be Vanilla, Snapshot, etc...\r\n3. Modify the GawdServer.conf to configure how your server is launched.\r\n4. Drag any plugin **_.Jar_** files to the **_plugins_** folder.\r\n5. Open Command Prompt or Shell run the following command:\r\n```\r\njava -jar GawdServer.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\nTo provide some basic functionality and to help demonstrate the API, I have created some basic plugins.\r\nDownloads for these plugins can be found [here](https://github.com/GawdServer/PluginList).\r\nIf you would like to have your plugin listed, please submit it [here](https://github.com/GawdServer/PluginList/issues/new).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
